Not Exactly What You Want?
--------------------------

Don't worry, you have options:

Fork This / Create Your Own
----------

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.

Or Submit a Pull Request
----------

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if they
make my own packaging experience better.
